# Agent TODOs

- [] (analyze, no edit) research on a data document structure that work across flutter and, go and python. Protobuf might be too complicated unless you can find an esay way to share
- [] (analyze, no edit) research on memory structure we can use that should be easy for agent to read and write to, probbaly into sections and flexible enough to extend
- [] implement workout history strucutre, should be flexible enough to adapt to anything with date, location, workout and sub-workouts (like the bisep curl set 1, interval work 1, interval rest 1 etc.)
- [] research how we can integrate ALL apple health data into the app
- [] start by loading all workout history into the app, use this time to test and iterate on workout data structure
- [] implement loading from apple health
