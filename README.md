# Hyper-Personalized AI Wellness Coach App

An app combining generative AI with behavioral science to create tailored wellness plans (fitness, nutrition, mental health). Unlike generic apps, it uses real-time data (wearables, user input) to adapt recommendations.

# Features

- Deep contextual understanding of user's historical and recent health conditions
- Personalized, data-driven wellness plans
- Real-time feedback and adjustments based on user data
- Gamified elements to increase engagement
- Privacy-first approach with on-device processing where needed

# Project Structure and Architecture

This project follows a modern, scalable architecture combining Flutter for the frontend and Python (FastAPI) for the backend services.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend (Flutter)
- Cross-platform mobile and web application
- Modular component architecture
- State management and real-time data synchronization
- Responsive UI with gamification elements

### Backend (Python)
- FastAPI-based REST API service
- AI/ML integration services
- Real-time data processing
- Secure authentication and data handling

### Key Technologies
- **Language & Frameworks**: Flutter (Dart), Python 3.11+, FastAPI
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI/Anthropic API integration
- **Development Tools**: 
  - Code formatting: Black (Python), Dart formatter
  - Linting: Ruff (Python)
  - Type checking: MyPy (Python)
  - Testing: pytest (Python), Flutter test framework

### Data Flow
1. User interaction via Flutter UI
2. Real-time data collection from wearables and user input
3. Backend processing and AI model integration
4. Personalized recommendations generation
5. Real-time UI updates and notifications

## Development Setup

# Tech Stack

### Framework: Flutter

Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Web)
Rich UI capabilities for gamified, flashy interfaces
Hot reload for rapid iteration

## Backend

Options:

Python: FastAPI for AI API integration
Go: High performance, functional approach
Serverless deployment (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)

## AI Integration

- API-based intelligence (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- (optional)On-device processing where privacy needed (TensorFlow Lite/CoreML)

## Testing Framework

Flutter Testing

Widget tests for component validation
Golden tests for UI screenshot comparison
Integration tests for full app flows

## CI/CD

Codemagic: Flutter-specific CI/CD with visual testing tools
Alternative: GitHub Actions with Flutter action

Development Workflow

Design → Code: Use screenshots + LLM to generate initial UI components
Iterate: Hot reload to quickly test and refine
Component library: Build reusable widgets for consistency
