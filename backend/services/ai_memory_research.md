# AI Memory Organization Research

## Overview

This document explores approaches to organizing "memory" for AI interactions in a health application. The memory system needs to handle multiple data sources and different health verticals while providing context-aware, personalized interactions.

## Data Sources

1. **Device Data (Apple Health)**
   - Workouts (running, cycling, swimming, etc.)
   - Heart rate measurements
   - Sleep tracking
   - Step count and activity
   - Weight and body measurements
   - Nutrition and water intake

2. **User Interactions**
   - Conversations with the AI
   - User-reported information
   - Goals and preferences
   - Feedback on AI suggestions

3. **Derived Insights**
   - Patterns identified from historical data
   - Progress towards goals
   - Anomalies or changes in health metrics
   - Correlations between different health factors

## Memory Organization Approaches

### 1. Hierarchical Memory Structure

Organize memory in a hierarchical structure with different levels of abstraction:

- **Long-term Memory**: Historical data, patterns, and user preferences
- **Working Memory**: Recent interactions and current context
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific events or interactions
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge about health and fitness

This approach allows the AI to access different types of information based on the context of the interaction.

### 2. Vertical-based Organization

Organize memory by health verticals:

- **Workout Memory**: Exercise history, preferences, goals
- **Sleep Memory**: Sleep patterns, quality, habits
- **Nutrition Memory**: Dietary habits, preferences, restrictions
- **Wellness Memory**: Stress levels, mindfulness, overall health

Each vertical can have its own structure and retrieval mechanisms while sharing common user information.

### 3. Temporal Organization

Organize memory based on time frames:

- **Recent Memory**: Last 7 days of data and interactions
- **Medium-term Memory**: Last 30-90 days
- **Long-term Memory**: Historical data beyond 90 days
- **Permanent Memory**: User preferences, medical conditions, etc.

This approach helps prioritize recent information while maintaining access to historical context.

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Memory Storage Format

**Structured Templates (YAML/JSON)**:
```yaml
workout_memory:
  recent_workouts:
    - date: "2023-04-10"
      type: "running"
      duration: 2305
      distance: 4665.0
      user_feedback: "felt good, slight knee pain"
  preferences:
    preferred_activities: ["running", "cycling"]
    avoid: ["high-impact exercises"]
  goals:
    current_goal: "run 5k under 25 minutes"
    progress: 80%
  insights:
    patterns: "performs better in morning workouts"
    improvements: "steady pace increase over last month"
```

**Markdown Templates**:
```markdown
# Workout Memory

## Recent Activities
- **Running** (April 10, 2023)
  - Duration: 38 minutes
  - Distance: 4.7 km
  - User feedback: "Felt good, slight knee pain"

## Preferences
- Prefers: Running, cycling
- Avoids: High-impact exercises

## Goals
- Current goal: Run 5k under 25 minutes
- Progress: 80%

## Insights
- Performs better in morning workouts
- Steady pace increase over last month
```

### 2. Memory Retrieval Mechanisms

- **Context-based Retrieval**: Retrieve memory based on the current conversation context
- **Keyword-based Retrieval**: Use keywords to access relevant memory sections
- **Temporal Retrieval**: Access memory based on time relevance
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Retrieve memory based on semantic similarity to the current topic

### 3. Memory Update Strategies

- **Incremental Updates**: Add new information without replacing existing memory
- **Summarization**: Periodically summarize detailed information to prevent memory overload
- **Forgetting Mechanisms**: Gradually reduce the importance of older, less relevant information
- **Reinforcement**: Strengthen memory of frequently accessed or important information

## Recommended Approach

Based on the research, a hybrid approach combining vertical-based organization with temporal aspects is recommended:

1. **Primary Organization**: Organize by health verticals (workout, sleep, nutrition, etc.)
2. **Secondary Organization**: Within each vertical, organize by time relevance
3. **Storage Format**: Use structured YAML/JSON for machine processing and Markdown for human readability
4. **Retrieval**: Implement context-based and semantic retrieval mechanisms
5. **Updates**: Use incremental updates with periodic summarization

## Example Memory Structure

```
memory/
├── user/
│   ├── profile.yaml
│   ├── preferences.yaml
│   └── medical_info.yaml
├── workout/
│   ├── recent.yaml
│   ├── history.yaml
│   ├── goals.yaml
│   └── insights.yaml
├── sleep/
│   ├── recent.yaml
│   ├── patterns.yaml
│   └── goals.yaml
├── nutrition/
│   ├── recent.yaml
│   ├── preferences.yaml
│   └── goals.yaml
└── conversations/
    ├── recent.yaml
    └── important.yaml
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement a prototype memory system using the recommended structure
2. Test memory retrieval in different conversation contexts
3. Develop mechanisms for updating memory based on new data and interactions
4. Create templates for different memory types
5. Integrate memory system with the AI conversation flow
